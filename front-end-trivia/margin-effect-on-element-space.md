How do margins affect the space an element occupies on a page in the CSS box model?

`margin` does not affect the calculated size (`width` and `height`) of the box itself. However, it does affect the total space the element occupies on the page by creating space around the element's `border`. This impacts the element's positioning relative to other elements.
