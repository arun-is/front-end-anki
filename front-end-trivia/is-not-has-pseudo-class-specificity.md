How do the `:is()`, `:not()`, and `:has()` pseudo-classes affect specificity in CSS?

---

- `:is()` takes the specificity of the most specific selector in its arguments.
- `:not()` and `:has()` use the specificity of their arguments directly.
- None of these pseudo-classes add any specificity weight themselves.
