What is the CSS box model and what elements does it apply to?

---

The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements in the document tree and laid out according to the visual formatting model. It applies to both `block` and `inline` elements, though it behaves differently for each. Each box has a content area and optional surrounding padding, border, and margin areas.
