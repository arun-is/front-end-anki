What does the CSS box model calculate, and which parts can collapse?

---

The CSS box model calculates:

1. How much space an element takes up
2. Whether margins collapse in certain cases (such as between vertically adjacent `block-level` elements)
3. A box's dimensions

Note: Borders do not collapse, only margins can in specific situations.
