What determines the height of a block element if no height is specified?

---

If no `height` is specified, a block element will be as high as:

1. The content it contains
2. Plus `padding`
3. Influenced by the `line-height` property if not explicitly set

Note: Floats can affect height in more complex ways, which is a special case.
